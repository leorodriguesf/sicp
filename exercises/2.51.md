## Exercise 2.51

Define the `below` operation for painters. `Below` takes two painters as
arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in
the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define `below`
in two different waysâ€”first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the
`beside` procedure given above, and again in terms of `beside` and suitable
rotation operations (from [Exercise 2.50](./2.50.md)).

## Solution

### Writing a procedure that is analogous to the `beside` procedure given above

```scheme
#lang racket

(require sicp-pict)

(define (below painter1 painter2)
  (let ((paint-down (transform-painter
                      painter1
                      (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
                      (make-vect 1.0 0.0)
                      (make-vect 0.0 0.5)))
        (paint-up (transform-painter
                    painter2
                    (make-vect 0.0 0.5)
                    (make-vect 1.0 0.5)
                    (make-vect 0.0 1.0))))
    (lambda (frame)
      (paint-down frame)
      (paint-up frame))))
```

### In terms of `beside` and suitable rotation operations

```scheme
#lang racket

(require sicp-pict)

(define (below painter1 painter2)
  (rotate90 (beside (rotate270 painter1)
                    (rotate270 painter2))))

(paint (below einstein einstein))
```
