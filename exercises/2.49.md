## Exercise 2.49

Use `segments->painter` to define the following primitive painters:

1. The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.
2. The painter that draws an “X” by connecting opposite corners of the frame.
3. The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the midpoints of the
   sides of the frame.
4. The `wave` painter.

## Solution

### 1. The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame

```scheme
(segments->painter
  (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0) (make-vect 1 0))
        (make-segment (make-vect 1 0) (make-vect 1 1))
        (make-segment (make-vect 1 1) (make-vect 0 1))
        (make-segment (make-vect 0 1) (make-vect 0 0))))
```

### 2. The painter that draws an “X” by connecting opposite corners of the frame

```scheme
(segments->painter
  (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0) (make-vect 1 1))
        (make-segment (make-vect 0 1) (make-vect 1 0))))
```

### 3. The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the frame

```scheme
(segments->painter
  (list (make-segment (make-vect 0.5 0.0) (make-vect 1.0 0.5))
        (make-segment (make-vect 1.0 0.5) (make-vect 0.5 1.0))
        (make-segment (make-vect 0.5 1.0) (make-vect 0.0 0.5))
        (make-segment (make-vect 0.0 0.5) (make-vect 0.5 0.0))))
```

### 4. The `wave` painter

For the previous painters, the points basically suggest themselves from symmetry
and midpoints. For the wave, there is no unique “right” set of coordinates, we
are pushed to design them to “looks like” the intended picture.

But there is not secret, our `segments->painter` procedure know how to draw line
segments, right? The wave is the same thing, but we need to think of very small
line segments, smaller enough so that we could approximate a curve-like shape
with line segments.

This wave painter exercise is basically a baby version of curve approximation,
and we would use derivative as a tool if we wanted our line segments not to just
pass through points, but also match the smoothness of a continuous function.

This set of points below are AI generated:

```scheme
(segments->painter
   (list
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.00 0.50) (make-vect 0.12 0.66))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.12 0.66) (make-vect 0.28 0.34))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.28 0.34) (make-vect 0.44 0.66))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.44 0.66) (make-vect 0.60 0.34))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.60 0.34) (make-vect 0.76 0.66))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.76 0.66) (make-vect 0.92 0.50))
      (make-segment (make-vect 0.92 0.50) (make-vect 1.00 0.50))))
```
