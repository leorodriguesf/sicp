## Exercise 2.39

Complete the following definitions of `reverse` ([Exercise 2.18](./2.18.md)) in
terms of `fold-right` and `fold-left` from [Exercise 2.38](./2.38.md):

```scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-right
   (lambda (x y) ⟨??⟩) nil sequence))

(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-left
   (lambda (x y) ⟨??⟩) nil sequence))
```

## Solution

```scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-right
   (lambda (x y)
     (append y (list x)))
     '() sequence))

(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-left
   (lambda (x y)
     (cons y x))
     '() sequence))
```
