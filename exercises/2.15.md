## Exercise 2.15

Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals using Alyssa’s system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such a form that no variable that represents an uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a “better” program for parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? Why?

## Solution

She is right. In interval arithmetic, each occurrence of a variable representing uncertain quantity is treated as if it were independent, even if it's the same variable repeated.

This means that when a formula references the same uncertain interval multiple times - as in the `par1` procedure - the resulting interval tends to have artificially inflated width (error bounds).

This happens because the arithmetic combines uncertainties conservatively, assuming the worst case scenario in which errors from each instance accumulate independently. As a result, the computed interval is wider than necessary, and the estimate deviates more from the true mathematical value.

On the other hand, rewriting the formula to avoid repeated references to the same uncertain variable - as done in `par2` - prevents this overestimation. Each uncertain interval appears only once in the computation, so the propagated uncertainty reflects the actual tolerance without compounding artificially.

Therefore, the `par2` version produces tighter error bounds and better approximations, making it a "better" procedure for parallel resistances in interval arithmetic.
