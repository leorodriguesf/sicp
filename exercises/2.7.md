## Exercise 2.7

Alyssaâ€™s program is incomplete because she has not specified the implementation of the interval abstraction. Here is a definition of the interval constructor:

```scheme
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
```

Define selectors `upper-bound` and `lower-bound` to complete the implementation.

## Solution

```scheme
(define (lower-bound interval) (car interval))
(define (upper-bound interval) (cdr interval))
```
