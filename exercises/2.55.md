## Exercise 2.55

Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

```scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

To her surprise, the interpreter prints back `quote`. Explain.

## Solution

First, we need to recall that the quotation mark (`'`) is just an abbreviation
for the procedure `quote`. So, we can rewrite the expression as:

```scheme
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
```

The `quote` procedure is a special form that do not try to evaluate its
arguments. Instead, its argument is just a literal representation of a data
structure. So the outer `quote` transform its argument `(quote abracadabra)`
into a literal list with 2 symbols:

- `quote`
- `abracadabra`

`car` then selects the first symbol of the list, which is the word `quote`.
