## Exercise 2.16

Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

## Solution

In interval arithmetic, each occurrence of a variable representing uncertain quantity is treated as if it were independent, even if it's the same variable repeated.

This means that when a formula references the same uncertain interval multiple times, the resulting interval tends to have artificially inflated width (error bounds).

This happens because the arithmetic combines uncertainties conservatively, assuming the worst case scenario in which errors from each instance accumulate independently. As a result, the computed interval is wider than necessary, and the estimate deviates more from the true mathematical value.

Therefore, repeated references to the same uncertain variable may lead to different results even though the algebraic expressions are mathematically equivalent.

To devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, the system would need to track dependencies or correlations between multiple ocurrences of the same variable. Basic interval arithmetic does not do this and treats all variables as independent intervals.

More advanced frameworks - such as affine arithmetic or symbolic interval methods - can track such dependencies and produce tighter bounds. However, these approaches increase the complexity of the system and computation.

Thus, without such extensions, it is impossible to fully eliminate this shortcoming within standard interval arithmetic.
