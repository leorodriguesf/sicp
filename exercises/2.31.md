## Exercise 2.31

Abstract your answer to [Exercise 2.30](./2.30.md) to produce a procedure
`tree-map` with the property that `square-tree` could be defined as:

```scheme
(define (square-tree tree)
  (tree-map square tree))
```

## Solution

```scheme
(define (tree-map fn tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) '())
        ((pair? tree) (cons (tree-map fn (car tree))
                            (tree-map fn (cdr tree))))
        (else (fn tree))))

(define (square-tree tree)
  (tree-map square tree))
```
