## Exercise 2.66

Implement the `lookup` procedure for the case where the set of records is
structured as a binary tree, ordered by the numerical values of the keys.

## Solution

```scheme
(define (key record) (car record))
(define (empty? set-of-records) (null? set-of-records))

(define (entry tree) (car tree))
(define (left-branch tree) (cadr tree))
(define (right-branch tree) (caddr tree))

(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (if (empty? set-of-records)
    #f
    (let* ((record (entry set-of-records))
           (record-key (key record)))
      (cond ((= given-key record-key) record)
            ((< given-key record-key)
             (lookup given-key (left-branch set-of-records)))
            (else (lookup given-key (right-branch set-of-records)))))))
```
