## Exercise 2.25

Give combinations of `car`s and `cdr`s that will pick 7 from each of the
following lists:

```scheme
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
```

## Solution

```scheme
(define x '(1 3 (5 7) 9))
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr x)))))
> 7

(define x '((7)))
(car (car x))
> 7

(define x '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))))
> (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr x))))))))))))
```
