## Exercise 2.9

The _width_ of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted). Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

## Solution

Given 2 intervals denoted by ($a_1$, $b_1$) and ($a_2$, $b_2$) we can calculate their widths:

$
w_1 = \frac{b_1 - a_1}{2}
$

$
w_2 = \frac{b_2 - a_2}{2}
$

### Sum

If we compute the bounds of the sum, we get a new interval ($a_1 + a_2$, $b_1 + b_2$). To calculate its width:

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 + b_2) - (a_1 + a_2)}{2}
$

We can rewrite the expression as:

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 - a_1) + (b_2 - a_2)}{2}
$

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 - a_1)}{2} + \frac{(b_2 - a_2)}{2}
$

$
w_3 = w_1 + w_2
$

### Subtraction

If we compute the bounds of the subtraction, we get a new interval ($a_1 - b_2$, $b_1 - a_2$). To calculate its width:

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 - a_2) - (a_1 - b_2)}{2}
$

We can rewrite the expression as:

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 - a_1) + (b_2 - a_2)}{2}
$

$
w_3 = \frac{(b_1 - a_1)}{2} + \frac{(b_2 - a_2)}{2}
$

$
w_3 = w_1 + w_2
$

### Multiplication and division by examples

```scheme
(define interval-a (make-interval 6.12 7.48))
(define interval-b (make-interval 4.465 4.935))

(width (mul-interval interval-a interval-b))
> 4.7940000000000005

(* (width interval-a) (width interval-b))
> 0.15979999999999994

(width (div-interval interval-a interval-b))
> 0.21756518956966886

(/ (width interval-a) (width interval-b))
> 2.893617021276598
```
