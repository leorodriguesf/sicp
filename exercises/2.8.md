## Exercise 2.8

Using reasoning analogous to Alyssaâ€™s, describe how the difference of two intervals may be computed. Define a corresponding subtraction procedure, called `sub-interval`.

## Solution

First lets see Alyssa's reasoning:

> "She reasons that the minimum value the sum could be is the sum of the two lower bounds and the maximum value it could be is the sum of the two upper bounds"

The analogous reasoning could be though as:

- The minimum value the subtraction could be is the difference between the first lower bound and the second upper bound
- The maximum value the subtraction could be is the difference between the first upper bound and the second lower bound

```scheme
(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (lower-bound x)
                    (upper-bound y))
                 (- (upper-bound x)
                    (lower-bound y))))
```
