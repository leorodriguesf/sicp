## Exercise 2.45

`Right-split` and `up-split` can be expressed as instances of a general
splitting operation. Define a procedure `split` with the property that
evaluating

```scheme
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))
```

produces procedures `right-split` and `up-split` with the same behaviors as the
ones already defined.

## Solution

```scheme
(define (split combine1 combine2)
  (define (recur painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
        painter
        (let ((smaller (recur painter (- n 1))))
          (combine1 painter (combine2 smaller smaller)))))
  recur)
```
