## Exercise 2.14

Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals $A$
and $B$
, and use them in computing the expressions $A/A$
and $A/B$
. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see Exercise [2.12](./2.12.md)).

## Solution

Let's construct the intervals $A$ and $B$ with a small tolerance:

```scheme
(define A (make-center-percent 10 1))
(define B (make-center-percent 5 1))
```

Now we can compute the expressions $\frac{A}{A}$ and $\frac{A}{B}$:

```scheme
(div-interval A A)
> '(0.9801980198019803 . 1.02020202020202)

(div-interval A B)
> '(1.9603960396039606 . 2.04040404040404)
```

Now we can convert back to center form:

```scheme
(center (div-interval A A))
> 1.0002000200020003
(percent (div-interval A A))
> 1.9998000199979908
```

```scheme
(center (div-interval A B))
> 2.0004000400040005
(percent (div-interval A B))
> 1.9998000199979908
```

This shows an interesting fact in our interval arithmetic. Mathematically we would expect:

- $\frac{A}{A}$ = 1
- $\frac{A}{B}$ = 2

But what we've got is:

- $\frac{A}{A}$ = 1.0002000200020003
- $\frac{A}{B}$ = 2.0004000400040005
