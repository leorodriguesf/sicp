## Exercise 2.13

Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances there is a simple formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify the problem by assuming that all numbers are positive.

## Solution

Assume we have 2 intervals:

$$
a \pm e_a = [a - e_a, a + e_a]
$$

$$
b \pm e_b = [b - e_b, b + e_b]
$$

When we multiply the intervals (assuming that all numbers are positive), the result will be:

$$
(a - e_a) \times (b - e_b) = ab - ae_b - be_a + e_ae_b
$$

$$
(a + e_a) \times (b + e_b) = ab + ae_b + be_a + e_ae_b
$$

Because the product $e_ae_b$ are small enough, we can ignore it:

$$
(a - e_a) \times (b - e_b) = ab - ae_b - be_a
$$

$$
(a + e_a) \times (b + e_b) = ab + ae_b + be_a
$$

So, the product will be:

$$
(a \pm e_a) \times (b \pm e_b) = [ab - ae_b - be_a, ab + ae_b - be_a]
$$

$$
(a \pm e_a) \times (b \pm e_b) = ab \pm (ae_b + be_a)
$$

Thus we can assume the absolute tolerance of the product will be:

$$
ae_b + be_a
$$

Note that this is the absolute tolerance. To calculate the percentage tolerance of the product we do:

$$
\frac{\text{width of the result}}{\text{center of the result}} = \frac{ae_b + be_a}{ab}
$$

Let's simply:

$$
\frac{ae_b + be_a}{ab}= \frac{ae_b}{ab} + \frac{be_a}{ab} = \frac{e_b}{b} + \frac{e_a}{a}
$$

So we can conclude:

$$
\text{Percentage tolerance of the product} \approx \text{Percentage tolerance of $a$} + \text{Percentage tolerance of $b$}
$$
