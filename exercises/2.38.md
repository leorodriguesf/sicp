## Exercise 2.38

The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right`, because it combines
the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements
to the right. There is also a `fold-left`, which is similar to `fold-right`,
except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
        result
        (iter (op result (car rest))
              (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left  list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that `fold-right` and
`fold-left` will produce the same values for any sequence.

## Solution

First, lets solve for the values:

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
> 3/2

(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))
> 1/6

(fold-right list '() (list 1 2 3))
> (1 (2 (3 ())))

(fold-left  list '() (list 1 2 3))
> (((() 1) 2) 3)
```

`op` should satisfy the associative property to procude the same values.
Associativity ensures that the grouping of operations does not matter:

```
(op 1 (op 2 (op 3 initial))) = (op (op (op initial 1) 2) 3)
```
