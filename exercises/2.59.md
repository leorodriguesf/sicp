## Exercise 2.59

Implement the `union-set` operation for the unordered-list representation of
sets.

## Solution

We can solve using recursion:

```scheme
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) #f)
        ((equal? x (car set)) #t)
        (else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))

(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (if (element-of-set? x set)
      set
      (cons x set)))

(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (if (null? set1)
    set2
    (adjoin-set (car set1)
                (union-set (cdr set1)
                           set2))))
```

Or, we can use a higher order procedure:

```scheme
(define (accumulate fn initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
    initial
    (fn (car sequence)
        (accumulate fn initial (cdr sequence)))))

(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (accumulate adjoin-set set2 set1))
```
