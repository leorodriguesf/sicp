## Exercise 2.50

Define the transformation `flip-horiz`, which flips painters horizontally, and
transformations that rotate painters counterclockwise by 180 degrees and 270
degrees.

## Solution

```scheme
#lang racket

(require sicp-pict)

(define (flip-horiz painter)
  (transform-painter
    painter
    (make-vect 1 0)
    (make-vect 0 0)
    (make-vect 1 1)))

(paint (flip-horiz einstein))

(define (rotate180 painter)
  (transform-painter
    painter
    (make-vect 1 1)
    (make-vect 0 1)
    (make-vect 1 0)))

(paint (rotate180 einstein))

(define (rotate270 painter)
  (transform-painter
    painter
    (make-vect 0 1)
    (make-vect 0 0)
    (make-vect 1 1)))

(paint (rotate270 einstein))
```
