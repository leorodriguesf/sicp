## Exercise 2.24

Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))`. Give the
result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer structure,
and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in Figure 2.6).

## Solution

The interpreter will print:

```scheme
(1 (2 (3 4)))
```

The box-and-point structure and the interpretation as a tree are shown below:
